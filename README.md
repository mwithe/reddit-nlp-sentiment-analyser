# Reddit Sentiment Analyser
Re-upload of a full-stack web application developed with a partner for a Cloud Computing subject. The application pulls user posts and comments via the Reddit API, and utilises the Node-NLP package to perform a Named Entity Recognition and sentiment analysis to rate the sentiment towards certain topics. This application worked particularly well for sporting subreddits such as r/NRL, r/NFL, etc.

### AWS Deployment
This project was deployed to AWS, scaling in and out to multiple ec2 instances, through an auto-scaling group and load balancer. Scaling was dependant on the CPU load generated by running multiple apps. It had persistent storage through DynamoDB and Redis caching. Unfortunatently, the site may run into hiccups as the AWS credentials are no longer available.

### Instructions
1. **Clone** the repository https://github.com/mwithe/reddit-nlp-sentiment-analyser
2. Enter the cloned directory and **npm install** to terminal
3. **npm start**
4. Access at localhost:3000

Site may take 10-30 seconds while the API calls and NLP takes place.
